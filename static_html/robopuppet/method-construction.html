          <p class="sectionTitle"><b>Download the CAD model of the target robot</b></p>
          <p class="sectionText">Many robots have CAD files available for download. Any file format that can be opened in FreeCAD can be used. Additional file formats may require a different software choice. For the TX90L robotic arm, we downloaded the *.stp files. </p>
          <p class="sectionTitle"><b>Inspect each joint surface</b> to be articulated - use these observations to determine the size of the puppet</p>
          <p class="sectionText">The joint axes of most robotic joints are centered on the joint surface. This was the case for all but one joint in the TX90L robotic arm. These joints are perfect candidates for the <em>Joint Encoder Assemblies</em> and <em>Pocket Geometries</em>. In order to use the pocket geometries, simply center the encoder void(the portion of the pocket geometry that contains the encoder's base) on the joint surface. A size for the final puppet can be determined by looking at the smallest joint that is to contain a standard <em>joint encoder assembly</em> and scaling that joint surface to fit the <em>pocket geometries. </em>The robot should be scalled around this value.</p>
          <p class="sectionText">Joints that do not have the joint surface to fit the generic joint fixture will require the fixture for that joint to be modified. In our puppet this includes the joint between link 4 and link 5 and the joint between link 5 and link 6. In order to accommodate the potentiometer in the smaller joint surface area on link 4 for the joint between link 4 and link 5 the generic joint fixture was move deeper into the link and an access tunnel was added to allow access. The joint between link 5 and link 6 is very different from other joints in the robot, for this joint a custom pocket geometry was made that was just large enough to accommodate the potentiometer base in the side of the link.</p>
          <p class="sectionText">We found that the puppet for the TX90L should be scaled to 30% of the target robot's size.</p>

                <p>NOTE - In order to minimize support structures and potential printing issues it is benefitial to ensure that the model is placed/oriented on the printing platform in such a way that there is a flat surface on the printing platform and overhangs are minimized as much as possible.</p>
                <p>NOTE -  It is worthwhile to print any pieces that are completely round or curved in two pieces so that there is at least one flat suface to place on the printer platform. It may be neccesary to add additional access tunnels or mounting holes in order to achieve this goal. An example of this can be seen <a href="images/methods/split_example.PNG">here</a>, where link 3, the 'upper arm' of the robotic arm was split in two legnth wise and additional mounting holes were added to allow the installion of bolts to keep the two pieces together. </p>
                <p>Print the piece using the settings appropriate to your printer. We used the following settings:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Infill - 10%<br />
                    'Standard Quality' - 2 shells, 0.20 mm height <br />
