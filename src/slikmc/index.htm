<p> <b> Abstract. </b>
We present a new Monte Carlo technique, Sub-Loop Inverse Kinematics Monte Carlo (SLIKMC), for
sampling configurations of a kinematic chain according to a
specified probability density while accounting for loop closure
constraints. A key contribution is a method for sampling subloops
in unbiased fashion using analytical inverse kinematics
techniques. Sub-loops are then iterated across the chain to produce
samples for the entire chain. The method is demonstrated
to scale well to high-dimensional chains (&gt;200DOFs) and is
applied to flexible 2D chains, protein molecules, and robots
with multiple closed-chains.
