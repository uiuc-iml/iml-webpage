<h2>Autonomous Robot Packing of Complex-shaped Objects</h2>

<h3>Fan Wang,&nbsp;Yifan Zhu, Kris Hauser</h3>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>With the unprecedented growth of the E-Commerce market, robotic warehouse automation has attracted much interest and capital investment. Compared to a conventional labor-intensive approach, an automated robot warehouse brings potential benefits such as increased uptime, higher total throughput, and lower accident rates. To date, warehouse automation has mostly developed in inventory mobilization and object picking.</p>

<p>Recently, one area that has attracted a lot of research attention is automated packaging or packing, a process during which robots stow objects into small confined spaces, such as shipping boxes. Packing items densely improves the storage capacity, decreases the delivery cost, and saves packing materials. However, it is a demanding manipulation task that has not been thoroughly explored by the research community.</p>

<p>This project&nbsp;focuses on packing objects of arbitrary shapes, weights, and deformation into a single shipping box with a robot manipulator. We&nbsp;seek to advance the state-of-the-art in robot packing with regards to optimizing container size for a set of objects, planning object placements for stability and feasibility, and increasing robustness of packing execution with a robot manipulator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Current progress has resulted in a software and hardware system comprising a robot work cell that acquires 3D models of objects, optimizes their packing locations to improve packing density, and packs them into the chosen container using a robot manipulator. The system can also compute the smallest container that contains all items from a discrete set of possible containers, which minimizes shipping cost and waste. The system also implements robustness measures to increase the success rate of the packing system under real-world uncertainties.</p>

<p>In preliminary experiments, our prototype system is able to achieve 98% success rates in packing item sets of five items, chosen at random from a set of 12 possible household items, into cardboard shipping boxes.</p>
