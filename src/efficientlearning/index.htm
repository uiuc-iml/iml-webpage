<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Recent breakthroughs in deep learning has made it a popular approach in various fields of engineering and science, including robotics. While deep learning has demonstrated impressive results, it is extremely data-hungary and transfers poorly to new tasks once trained. However, data in robotics tasks are often times scarce and very expensive. In this project, we investigate data-efficient learning for robotics (decision-making) tasks by 1) taking advantage of knowledge of physics and performing "gray-box" learning and 2) using prior experience on similar tasks.</p>

<p>We demonstrate on 3 challenging real-world robotics tasks the data-efficiency of gray-box learning compared to black-box learning, including dynamics learning of locomotion granular media, visuo-tactile model learning of deformable objects, and automated heart and lung auscultation. In addition, based on the learned dynamics model on granular terrains, we propose a trajectory optimization framework using bi-level optimization to plan robot locomotion trajectories on sandy terrains, which is a very challenging task. </p>

<p>We are currently investigating the problem of meta-learning surrogate scoring functions for the few-shot regrasping problem. By training on a variety of related objects offline, we aim to enable the robot to quickly adapt to a novel object when facing failed attempts. </p>

                <h4>Meta-learning few-shot regrasping</h4>
                <p>This project is ongoing. In this project, we are currently investigating the problem of meta-learning surrogate scoring functions for the few-shot regrasping problem. This is a challenging task because in addition to the visual variations of real-world objects, they often present characteristics that are not directly observable, such as center of mass. Another challenge is the goal to successfully regrasping a novel object with feedback from a few failed attempts. We are currently looking into meta-learning to address these challenges.</p>

                <h4>Automated Heart and Lung Auscultation in Robotic Physical Examinations</h4>
                <p> This paper presents the first implementation of autonomous robotic auscultation of heart and lung sounds. To
                    select auscultation locations that generate high-quality sounds,
                    a Bayesian Optimization (BO) formulation leverages visual
                    anatomical cues to predict where high-quality sounds might be
                    located, while using auditory feedback to adapt to patient-specific
                    anatomical qualities. Sound quality is estimated online using
                    machine learning models trained on a database of heart and lung
                    stethoscope recordings. Experiments on 4 human subjects show
                    that our system autonomously captures heart and lung sounds of
                    similar quality compared to tele-operation by a human trained in
                    clinical auscultation. Surprisingly, one of the subjects exhibited
                    a previously unknown cardiac pathology that was first identified
                    using our robot, which demonstrates the potential utility of
                    autonomous robotic auscultation for health screening.</p> <a href="../papers/RAL2022-Zhu-Ascultation-preprint.pdf"><img class="pdf"  src="../images/pdf_icon_tiny.gif" alt="pdf"></a>

                <h4>Semi-Empirical Simulation of Learned Force Response Models for Heterogeneous Elastic Objects</Object></h4>
                <p>This paper presents a semi-empirical method for
                    simulating contact with elastically deformable objects whose
                    force response is learned using entirely data-driven models.
                    A point-based surface representation and an inhomogeneous,
                    nonlinear force response model are learned from a robotic arm
                    acquiring force-displacement curves from a small number of
                    poking interactions. The simulator then estimates displacement
                    and force response when the deformable object is in contact
                    with an arbitrary rigid object. It does so by estimating displacements by solving a Hertzian contact model, and sums the
                    expected forces at individual surface points through querying
                    the learned point stiffness models as a function of their expected
                    displacements. Experiments on a variety of challenging objects
                    show that our approach learns force response with sufficient
                    accuracy to generate plausible contact response for novel rigid
                    objects.</p>

                <h4>Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization with Learned Deformable Contacts Using Bilevel Optimization</h4>
                <p> Based on the previous project shown below, we present a bilevel, contact-implicit trajectory
                    optimization (TO) formulation that searches for robot trajectories with learned soft contact models. On the lower-level, contact
                    forces are solved via a quadratic program (QP) with the maximum dissipation principle (MDP), based on which the dynamics
                    constraints are formulated in the upper-level TO problem that
                    uses direct transcription. Our method uses a contact model
                    for granular media that is learned from physical experiments,
                    but is general to any contact model that is stick-slip, convex,
                    and smooth. We employ a primal interior-point method with
                    a pre-specified duality gap to solve the lower-level problem,
                    which provides robust gradient information to the upper-level
                    problem. We evaluate our method by optimizing locomotion
                    trajectories of a quadruped robot on various granular terrains
                    offline, and show that we can obtain long-horizon walking gaits
                    of high qualities.</p>

            <h4>A Data-driven Approach for Fast Simulation of Robot Locomotion on Granular Media</h4>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a semi-empirical approach for simulating robot locomotion on granular media. We
                first develop a contact model based on the stick-slip behavior
                between rigid objects and granular grains, which is then learned
                through running extensive experiments. The contact model
                represents all possible contact wrenches that the granular
                substrate can provide as a convex volume, which our method
                formulates as constraints in an optimization-based contact force
                solver. During simulation, granular substrates are treated as
                rigid objects that allow penetration and the contact solver solves
                for wrenches that maximize frictional dissipation. We show that
                our method is able to simulate plausible interaction response
                with several granular media at interactive rates.</p>
