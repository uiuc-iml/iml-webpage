<p> <b> Abstract. </b>
The classical Capture Point (CP) technique allows
biped robots to take protective footsteps in case of a push
or other disturbance, but only applies to flat terrain and
a horizontally-moving Center of Mass (CoM). This paper
generalizes the Capture Point technique to arbitrary terrains
and CoM paths. Removing the CoM path constraint leads
to an infinite number of Capture Points, each corresponding
to a different path. A numerical algorithm is presented that,
given an uneven terrain, enumerates Capture Points and their
respective CoM trajectories. It is suitable for real-time usage
as it produces all capture points in less than a millisecond on
a standard PC. Proof-of-concept results are also demonstrated
on a humanoid robot in a dynamic simulator.</p>
