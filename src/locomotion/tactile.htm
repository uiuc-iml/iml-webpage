Docking With Uncertain Shapes</h2>

<p> <b> Abstract. </b>
This paper presents a Bayesian approach for active tactile  exploration  of  a  planar  shape  in  the  presence  of  both localization and shape uncertainty. The goal is to dock the robot's end-effector against the shape -- reaching a point of contact that resists  a  desired  load  --  with  as  few  probing  actions  as  possible. The  proposed  method  repeatedly  performs  inference,  planning, and  execution  steps.  Given  a  prior  probability  distribution  over object   shape   and   sensor   readings   from   previously   executed motions, the posterior distribution is inferred using a novel and efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. The optimal docking site  is  chosen  to  maximize  docking  probability,  using  a  closed-
form  probabilistic  simulation  that  accepts  rigid  and  compliant motion  models  under  Coulomb  friction.  Numerical  experiments demonstrate that this method requires fewer exploration actions
to  dock  than  heuristics  and  information-gain  strategies.</p>
