<h2>Sampling-based Motion Planning With Dynamic Intermediate State Objectives: Application to Throwing</h2>
<h3>Yajia Zhang, Jingru Luo, and Kris Hauser.  To appear in ICRA 2012</h3>

<p> <b> Abstract. </b>
Dynamic manipulations require attaining high
velocities at specified configurations, all the while obeying
geometric and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a
motion planner that constructs a trajectory that passes at
an intermediate state through a dynamic objective region,
which is comprised of a certain lower dimensional submanifold
in the configuration/velocity state space, and then returns to
rest. Planning speed and reliability is greatly improved using
optimizations based on the fact that ramp-up and ramp-down
subproblems are coupled by the choice of intermediate state,
and that very few (often less than 1%) intermediate states yield
feasible solution trajectories. Simulation experiments demonstrate
that our method quickly generates trajectories for a 6-
DOF industrial manipulator throwing a small object.

    <div class="mediatext"><p>Our planner is used to command the robot to grasp a cube from ground and throw it into a box with target at its center.  Four scenarios are included: one which obstacle is near to the robot and the rest three which obstacles are placed between the robot and the target. A collision-free trajectory constructed by our sample-based planner satisfies both geometric and dynamic constraints.</p>

    <div class="mediatext"><p> An iterative learning process is used to throw the target accurately in the face of modeling errors in the planner.
	At high speeds, the landing position is sensitive to minor unmodeled gripper object interactions and errors in the feedback controller. We use observed feedback from past trials to adjust the trajectory in an iterative fashion.  Each adjustment is guaranteed to remain feasible. </p><p>WMV, 7.58mb</p></div>
